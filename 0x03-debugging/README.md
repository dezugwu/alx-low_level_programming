0x03. C - Debugging

it’s important to understand the concepts and processes of debugging manually.

Tasks

0. Multiple mains
In most projects, we often give you only one main file to test wit but this time youe will be given multiple files,
This file must test that the functions gives the correct output when given a case of 0 for example.

1. Like, comment, subscribe
Copy this main file. Comment out (don’t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.

2. 0 > 972?
This program prints the largest of three integers.
Fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.

3. Leap year
This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration.
Fix the print_remaining_days() function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.
